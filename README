Free free to give a play at my blackjack game here: little-cxx-blackjack.herokuapp.com

This basic blackjack game features: 
1. betting
  1) starting balance of $500
  2) checking invalid input when asked to enter a bet
  3) player can't play once balance goes below 0
2. checking soft hand
  if dealer has a soft hand and her total is 17, she would hit again instead of stay
3. shuffle-cards animation

I also borrowed some CSS animations from Daniel Eden and you can see my acknowledgement in the bye page.
